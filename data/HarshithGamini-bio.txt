I'm an undergrad at IIT Bhubaneshwar, obsessed with understanding things from ground up. I enjoy going deep â€” not just using tech, but understanding how and why things works. My vision is to make Virtual Reality (VR) tangible and accessible, empowering people to experience and build whatever they can imagine.
